"""This package contains utilities for managing the state of distributed model parallelism in Megatron and Apex.

In general you should just use the context manager `distributed_model_parallel_state` to manage the state of
your test. This context manager will handle the setup and teardown of the distributed model parallel state for you.

Example usage:
```python

from bionemo.testing import megatron_parallel_state_utils

def my_test():
    with megatron_parallel_state_utils.distributed_model_parallel_state():
        # your test code that requires megatron/apex parallel state to be set up here

    Key functions that are mocked:
        * `torch.distributed.new_group` when `backend="gloo"` which doesn't support a `backend="fake"`
        * `torch.distributed.destroy_process_group` when `backend="gloo"` since new "gloo" groups are not actually made

    Outside of this mocking, a fake cluster is initialized using `backend="fake"` in `torch.distributed`. This sets up
        enough global state and environment for megatron to think that it is initializing a larger cluster with some
        settings where the current context has some user defined rank. You can then test the megatron state on a
        hypothetical rank in some large world size.
