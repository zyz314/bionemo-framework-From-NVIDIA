class RemoteResource:
    """Responsible for downloading remote files, along with optional processing of downloaded files for downstream usecases.

    Each object is invoked through either its constructor (setting up the destination and checksum), or through a pre-configured class method.
    `download_resource()` contains the core functionality, which is to download the file at `url` to the fully qualified filename. Class methods
    can be used to further configure this process.

    Receive:
        a file, its checksum, a destination directory, and a root directory

        Our dataclass then provides some useful things:
            - fully qualified destination folder (property)
            - fully qualified destination file (property)
            - check_exists()
            - download_resource()

        Form the fully qualified destination folder.
        Create a fully qualified path for the file

        (all lives in the download routine)
        Check that the fq destination folder exists, otherwise create it
        Download the file.
        Checksum the download.
        Done.

        Postprocessing should be their own method with their own configuration.

    Example usage:
        >>> # The following will download and preprocess the prepackaged resources.
        >>> GRCh38Ensembl99ResourcePreparer().prepare()
        >>> Hg38chromResourcePreparer().prepare()
        >>> GRCh38p13_ResourcePreparer().prepare()


    Attributes:
        dest_directory: The directory to place the desired file upon completing the download. Should have the form {dest_directory}/{dest_filename}
        dest_filename: The desired name for the file upon completing the download.
        checksum: checksum associated with the file located at url. If set to None, check_exists only checks for the existance of `{dest_directory}/{dest_filename}`
        url: URL of the file to download
        root_directory: the bottom-level directory, the fully qualified path is formed by joining root_directory, dest_directory, and dest_filename.
