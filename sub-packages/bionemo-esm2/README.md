# bionemo-esm2
ESM-2 is a protein language model with BERT architecture trained on millions of protein sequences from UniProt. ESM-2 learns the patterns and dependencies between amino acids that ultimately give rise to a protein’s structure. ESM-2 is pretrained on a masked language model (MLM) objective. During pretraining, 15% of the input sequence is perturbed, and within which 80% of the residues are replaced with a mask token, 10% are replaced with a random token, and 10% are left unchanged. The model is then trained to predict the original amino acids at the perturbed positions with the context of the surrounding amino acids. [TODO path to pretraining notebook] explains how this can be done in BioNeMo2.

Despite pretraining on an MLM objective, the sequence representation learned by ESM-2 is highly transferable to downstream tasks. ESM-2 can be fine-tuned on a variety of tasks, including secondary structure prediction as, and whole-sequence prediction on cellular localization, thermostability, solubility, and other protein properties. [TODO path to finetuning notebook] explains how this can be done in BioNeMo2.
