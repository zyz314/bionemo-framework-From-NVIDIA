    """Creates a batching iterator where each batch size varries (within a max limit) according to memory consumption.

    A generator that batches elements from an iterable while ensuring that the
    total size of each batch does not exceed a specified maximum. Here the size
    can be a measurement of memory consumption of the elements in the batch.
    This can be useful for both indexible data or non-indexible but iterable data.

    Args:
        dataset: The input iterable.
        sizeof: A function or mapping that returns the "size" of each element in `dataset`.
            E.g., this can used to determine how much memory an element consumes. Its return
            type must be comparable with `max_total_size` and it must be addable (operator `+`).
        max_total_size: The maximum total "size" of each batch. The semantics of "size"
            is defined by the `sizeof` argument. The type of this value must be comparable
            with the return type of sizeof, i.e., the operator `<` and `==` must be meaningful.
        collate_fn: An optional function to collate batches. Defaults to None, in which case
            each batch is a list of elements from the input dataset
        info_logger: A function to log info. Defaults to None.
        warn_logger: A function to log warnings. Defaults to None.

    Yields:
        A generator that yields batches from `dataset`.

    -----------
    Assumptions
    1. Linear complexity. This function consumes the given Iterable of data (`dataset`) once,
       by going over the data item one by one to build a batch and yield it as soon as the
       addition of the next data item to the batch would exceed `max_total_size` or if the
       batch is the last one (end of iteration)
    2. Additive size measurement. For the general usage case of building mini-batches with
       a threshold of the batch's memory consumption, it assumes that the size of the batch is
       the sum of all elements in the batch (additive property).
    3. Comparable type of `max_total_size` and `sizeof`'s return. `sizeof`'s return values
       must be compared with `max_total_size` to threshold the size of batches


    ------
    Caveat
    1: The generated batch sizes may have large variance
       - how to workaround: filter the output of this generator using a batch size threshold
    2: The number of batches may vary a lot across different epochs.
       - how to workaround: increase the number of steps that compose an epoch,
         e.g., in the Lightning training/validation loop, which effectively increases the input
         dataset size per epoch

    Elements of the dataset are first grouped into each bucket based on the bucket ranges and the sizes of elements.
    Then, a base batch sampler is used for each bucket to create mini-batches.

    The bucket ranges are specified by `bucket_boundaries`, which will be first sorted internally and used to create
    `len(bucket_boundaries) - 1` left-closed right-open intervals.
    e.g. if bucket_boundaries tensor is [10, 5, 0, 16], it will be sorted as [0, 5, 10, 16] and 3 buckets will be created
    with ranges: [0, 5), [5, 10), [10, 16).

    The base batch sampler will be created by passing the element indices in each bucket as the data source, and
    `base_batch_sampler_shared_kwargs` and `base_batch_sampler_individual_kwargs`
    to the constructor of the base batch sampler class specified as `base_batch_sampler_class`.
    e.g. `base_batch_sampler_shared_kwargs = {'drop_last': True}` and `base_batch_sampler_individual_kwargs = {'batch_size': [8,10,12]}`
    will be used to create 3 batch samplers with drop_last=True and batch_size=8, 10 and 12, and initialized like
    `base_batch_sampler_class(bucket_element_indices[0], batch_size=8, drop_last=True)`.

    In the `__iter__` method, if `shuffle` is `True`, the element indices in each bucket will be shuffled, and a bucket
    is randomly selected each time to create a mini-batch. If `shuffle` is `False`, there is no shuffle on element indices,
    and the bucket is selected in ascending order of its interval boundaries.

    This class is used to create homogeneous batches of data for training or evaluation, and reduce the padding necessary to align the shape of elements.
