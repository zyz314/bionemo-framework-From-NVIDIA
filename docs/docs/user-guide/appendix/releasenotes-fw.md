# Release Notes


## BioNeMo Framework v2.0

### New Features:
* ESM-2 implementation
  * State of the art training performance and equivalent accuracy to the reference implementation
  * 650M, and 3B scale checkpoints available which mirror the reference model
  * Flexible fine-tuning examples that can be copied and modified to accomplish a wide variety of downstream tasks
* First version of our NeMo v2 based reference implementation which re-imagines bionemo as a repository of megatron models, dataloaders, and training recipes which make use of NeMo v2 for training loops.
  * Modular design and permissible Apache 2 OSS licenses enables the import and use of our framework in proprietary applications.
  * NeMo2 training abstractions allows the user to focus on the model implementation while the training strategy handles distribution and model parallelism.
* Documentation and documentation build system for BioNeMo 2.

###  Known Issues:
* PEFT support is not yet fully functional.
* Partial implementation of Geneformer is present, use at your own risk. It will be optimized and officially released in the future.
* Command line interface is currently based on one-off training recipes and scripts. We are working on a configuration based approach that will be released in the future.
* Fine-tuning workflow is implemented for BERT based architectures and could be adapted for others, but it requires you to inherit from the biobert base model config. You can follow similar patterns in the short term to load weights from an old checkpoint partially into a new model, however in the future we will have a more direct API which is easier to follow.
* Slow memory leak occurs during ESM-2 pretraining, which can cause OOM during long pretraining runs. Training with a
  microbatch size of 48 on 40 A100s raised an out-of-memory error after 5,800 training steps.
  * Possible workarounds include calling `gc.collect(); torch.cuda.empty_cache()` at every ~1,000 steps, which appears
    to reclaim the consumed memory; or training with a lower microbatch size and re-starting training from a saved
    checkpoint periodically.

* [Dependencies] Upgraded the framework to [NeMo v1.23](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/v1.23.0), which updates PyTorch to version 2.2.0a0+81ea7a4 and CUDA to version 12.3.

### Known Issues
* Minor training speed regression observed for models DNABERT, Geneformer, MolMIM
* Two known critical CVEs GHSA-cgwc-qvrx-rf7f, GHSA-mr7h-w2qc-ffc2. The vulnerabilities arise within a package that's installed by lightning by default. We do not use that package in bionemo framework container. we are also unable to remove the package in question as it's installed as a side-effect of installing lightning.
* Two known High CVEs from pytorch : GHSA-pg7h-5qx3-wjr3, GHSA-5pcm-hx3q-hm94.

## BioNeMo Framework v1.7
### New Models
* [DSMBind](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.10.570461v1), developed under the BioNeMo framework, is a model which can produce comparative values for ranking protein-ligand binding affinities. This release features the capability to perform inference using a newly trained checkpoint.
### New Features
* [EquiDock] Remove steric clashes as a post-processing step after equidock inference.
* [Documentation] Updated Getting Started section which sequentially describes prerequisites, BioNeMo Framework access, startup instructions, and next steps.

### Known Issues
* There is a known security vulnerability with NLTK that can allow for arbitrary code execution via pickle files that are external assets downloaded via nltk.download() (https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/3266). BioNeMo itself does not use this dependency in any way, however parts of NeMo text-to-speech (nemo.collections.tts) does use this vulnerable codepath. Since NeMo is installed in the BioNeMo release containers, users are urged to exercise caution when using  nemo.collections.tts or nltk.

## BioNeMo Framework v1.6
### New Features
* [Model Fine-tuning] `model.freeze_layers` fine-tuning config parameter added to freeze a specified number of layers. Thank you to github user [@nehap25](https://github.com/nehap25)!

* Numerous optimizations from [NVIDIA's entry to the MLPerf competition](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-openfold-training-for-drug-discovery/) have been added to OpenFold. Documentation and detailed benchmarks are works in progress and will be published in upcoming releases. This release contains the following performance optimizations:

* PyTorch Lightning upgraded to 2.0.7
* [NGC CLI](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli) has been removed from the release container. If users
    download models from inside the container (e.g. using `bionemo_data_download` or via running specific unit tests),
    the NGC CLI will be auto-installed to pull the models from NGC.

### Known Issues
* BioNeMo Framework v24.03 container is vulnerable to [GHSA-whh8-fjgc-qp73](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whh8-fjgc-qp73) in onnx 1.14.0. Users are advised not to open untrusted onnx files with this image. Restrict your mount point to minimize directory traversal impact.

## BioNeMo Framework v1.2
## New Models
* OpenFold implementation under BioNeMo framework, derived from public OpenFold and DeepMind AlphaFold-2.
* DNABERT implementation for computing embeddings for each nucleotide in the input DNA sequence.

* Wrapper scripts for DNABERT and OpenFold to launch jobs on BCP.

### Bug fixes and Improvements
* Interface improvements for ESM-2 data ingestion and pre-processing. The interface allows for explicit specification of training, validation, and test sets. The user may set `config.model.data.default_dataset_path` to maintain prior behavior, or set `config.model.data.train.dataset_path`, `config.model.data.val.dataset_path`, `config.model.data.test.dataset_path` which may all be unique.

### Known Issues
* OpenFold training speed does not yet include [MLPerf optimizations](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/scaling-ai-training-mlperf/), and these will be released in the subsequent release.

* Migration of inference notebooks to using pytriton.

### Bug fixes and Improvements

* Refactor of download_models.sh to download_models.py for easier CLI use.
* Refactor of install structure to move from /opt/nvidia to /workspace/bionemo. The environment variable $BIONEMO_HOME now points to the repo base and is required to be set for tests to pass.

### Security Notice

SchedMD Slurm in the release container is shipped with a security vulnerability, [CVE-2022-29501](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-29501), and therefore this version of Slurm should not be used to run a Slurm cluster (specifically, the processes `slurmdbd`, `slurmctld`, and `slurmd`.

In general, the BioNeMo Framework release is designed to ship code and an environment that would be executed on local workstations, or deployed on clusters for large scale training jobs. This container is not designed to run as a service with public facing APIs. A full summary of security vulnerabilities can be found [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara/containers/bionemo-framework/security).
